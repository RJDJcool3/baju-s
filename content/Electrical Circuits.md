### Static Charges
- Charge is a **property of matter**
	- It does not have a strong definition
- An **object of charge** <u>produces</u> an **electric field** around it
	- Properties of the Electric Field:
		- Extends to infinity
		- Other objects of charge experience an electric force when in the field
		- Has an electric force which decreases with distance from the object
			- This force may be <u>attractive or repulsive</u>
- *Static charge* refers to how the electric charge is not moving

#### 3 Charge States
- **2 Types of Charge**: positive and negative
	- Positive
		- e.g. protons, cations, $\alpha$, positrons
	- Negative
		- e.g. electrons, anions
	- The two types of charge behave oppositely
- **No charge/charges are balanced**: *Neutral* 
	- It itself is not a type of charge
	- e.g. neutron, neutrinos, atoms, etc.

### Electric Field Diagrams
- Charge is uniformly distributed around charged object
	- $\therefore$ Field lines are evenly distributed around object
	  ![[ElectricalFieldDiagrams|450]]
- Rules:
	- **Minimum of 4** field lines
		- Don't waste time with extra lines; minimise the amount you draw
		- Number of field lines indicate relative density for different objects
	- Must be an arrow going in correct direction
		- Outward for positive
		- Inward for negative
	- Lines must start/finish <u>at</u> the surface of the object
		- Lines should only touch the object, not pierce through
		- They should always come off the particle at **right angles** even if they will curve later
	- Should start/finish perpendicular to surface

#### Interactions Between 2 (or more) Charged Objects

![[InteractionsBetweenChargedObjects|800]]

- Figure 1. → positively charged object and negatively charged object
	- The electric field flows from the positive object to the negative object
	- *Note: This diagram is incorrect because the lines are not spaced evenly and they do not come off at right angles*
- Figure 2. → two objects with like charge
	- The electric fields repel each other and leave **empty space** between the objects
	- *Note: This diagram has an inaccuracy because it is missing a line from each particle (from the closest end to each other) which would curve up or down sharply*
- Figure 3. → two charged plates with opposite charge
	- The electric field flows from the positive charge plate to the negative charge plate
	- The field is curved on the edges of the plate
- Figure 4. → Charged plate and oppositely charged object
	- Electric field flows from positive object to negative plate (or vice versa)

### Transfer of Charge
- Friction will transfer $e^-$ from one surface to another
	- A **surface** with **greater affinity** for $e^-$ compared to a second surface, will **gain** $e^-$ and vice versa
		- Electron affinity is linked with **electronegativity**
- We cannot tell whether an object has gained positive or negative charge
	- We don't know which object gains/loses electrons

- *Charging by induction* is where **electrons are redistributed** on an object to produce regions of different charge (i.e. an electric dipole)
	- The separation of charge is temporary and will reverse once the inducing charge is removed
		- This is similar to how temporary dipoles work (from chemistry)
	- This can be observed by using an [electroscope](https://byjus.com/physics/electroscope/)
		- An *electroscope* is a scientific tool that can detect an electric charge on a body
		- It is composed of a pair of metal leaves hanging off a vertical metal rod contained within an insulating box
		  ![[Electroscope]]
- *Charging by conduction* is when electrons are physically transferred causing loss/gain of charge
	- This loss/gain of charge is not temporary

### Coulomb's Law
- Electrostatically charged objects **exert a force** upon one another
	- We can calculate the magnitude of this force using **Coulomb’s Law**
- Coulomb's Law: $F_e = \frac{k\ \times\ q_1q_2}{r^2}$
	- $F_e$ = the **electric force** acting between the two objects of charge
		- $F_e$ is **a vector** → either is an **attractive force** or a **repulsive force**
			- Two opposite charges → attractive force (towards each other)
			- Two like charges → repulsive force (away from each other)
	- $k$ = **constant** of proportionality = $9.00 \times 10^9$
		- Measured in $N\ m^2\ C^{-2}$ → (not important)
	- $q_1$, $q_2$ = the charges on the two charged objects
		- Measured in coulombs ($C$)
	- $r$ = radius/the **distance between** the two **objects**
