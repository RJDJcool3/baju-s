Hello! I'm [[Year 11/Articles/About Me|Ajay]] (or Bajay, or Ajay Bajay, or whatever you want to call me), this is my website of notes from Obsidian, which I was bullied into using by Jonathan Lee. Thank you Jonathan. If something seems off in this website, it was probably Jonathan who wrote it. Thank you to Jonathan, [Oscar](https://github.com/notmario) and [Edward](https://github.com/eddietheed) for being a massive help in setting this up!

I am a member of the town. Their sites can be found below.

Originally my notes were on OneNote (suffering) and a lot of them are still on there. Unfortunately unless you are on the Notes OneNote for 2023, you won't be able to access them. However I'm sure you can find use for all my notes on Obsidian! 

Don't be afraid to ask for my help for anything (except English), I'm a good listener, teacher and an ex-student councillor.

> [!warning]- Quartz doesn't like LaTeX or Excalidraw
> 
> I am a visual learner and thus I use many diagrams and drawings throughout my notes (90% are self-made). However since most of these are Excalidraw documents which are special text documents that are turned into images in Obsidian, they don't show up in my website (very sad). 
> 
> LaTeX equations (the fancy math stuff) also happens to format itself in a funky way due to how Quartz processes LaTeX differently to Obsidian. Just keep in mind that if something looks off, or really off, its because of this. I am happy to send you diagrams that I have so just let me know on discord! 

Big thank you to Jacky Zhao the creator of Quartz in which this website runs off. I don't know how it works, but it does.
