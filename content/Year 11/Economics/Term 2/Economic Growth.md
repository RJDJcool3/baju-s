### Introduction to Economic Growth
- **Economic Growth** refers to an **increase** in the **real output** of goods and services in a country over time
	- Economic growth can be **illustrated by an outward shift** of the nation's [[Economic Growth#Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)|production possibility frontier (PPF)]] over time
- Growth is the most important macroeconomic objective 
	- It determines **the rate** at which the economy expands to allow people to **satisfy more wants in the future**

#### Sustainable Economic Growth
- Even though economic growth increases material welfare, standards of living are an important consideration as a true measure of welfare
	- Economic growth does not necessarily mean true welfare is increases
- A sustainable rate of growth meets current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
- Sustainable growth has many positive effects:
	- Growth rate can be maintained
	- Keeps inflationary pressures under control
	- Helps to maintain lower unemployment
	- Reduces pressure on resource use
- Sustainability is broken into four aspects: human, social, economic and environmental

#### GDP as a Measure of Economic Growth
- GDP is a measure of economic activity
	- It is the total value of all final goods and services produced in a year

> <u>Nominal and Real GDP</u>
> 
> GDP is initially records the value of production in **current prices**. However **prices can vary over a time period** and thus the growth recorded may be a direct result of a price increase. 
> 
> GDP measured this way is called **nominal GDP**. To compare GDP over different time periods, the price changes must be taken into account since GDP should be a measure of the **value of production**. 
> 
> **Real GDP** adjust nominal GDP data to account for the shift in prices. **Real GDP** <u>describes</u> the **value of output** as if there had been **no price changes** in the economy.

- *Real GDP per capita* is the real GDP divided by the population of the economy
	- e.g. a country with a real GDP of $5 billion with a population of $1 million has a GDP per capita of $5000

#### Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)
- TBF

#### Aggregate Production Function (APF)
- TBF ([Link](https://www.studysmarter.co.uk/explanations/macroeconomics/economic-performance/aggregate-production-function/#:~:text=The%20aggregate%20production%20function%20is%20a%20hypothetical%20equation%20that%20shows,to%20the%20number%20of%20inputs.))

### Determinants of Growth
- <span style="color:lime;">Actual Growth</span> vs <span style="color:gold;">Potential Growth</span>
	- <span style="color:lime;">Actual Growth</span> is the **actual output of the economy**
		- GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
		- Determinants of actual growth involve components of aggregate demand or expenditure that influence GDP
			- These affect the demand side of the economy (aggregate expenditure)
	- <span style="color:gold;">Potential Growth</span> refers to changes in **quantity and/or quality of FOP**
		- Its a **measure** of the **capacity of the economy**
		- Determinants of potential growth involve factors that influence the quantity and/or quality of factors of production
			- These affect the supply side of the economy
		- Increases in **capital goods, labour force, technology, and human capital** can all contribute to economic growth
			- These are known as **'drivers of economic growth'**
			- *Human capital* refers to employee skills and knowledge

#### Investment and Economic Growth
- Allocating scarce funds to capital goods is known as **real investment**
- To achieve potential growth, more resources should go to **producing capital goods** over consumer goods
	- **Standards of living (SOL)** are **reduced in the short run** as resources are diverted away from private consumption
- However, increased investment in capital goods → greater output of **consumer goods** in the **long run**
	- SOL will increase in the future more than they would have if the economy had not made a short-term sacrifice
	- Economies face a **choice** between **short-term vs long-term** benefit

##### Investment in New Technology
- Potential growth increases because new technology is inevitably more efficient than old technology
	- Production can increase because the new technology is more efficient
		- Output does not necessarily increase
- Actual growth increases due to <span style="color:aqua;">investment</span>
	- There is a transaction to buy the new technology which becomes a part of the GDP

##### Failure to Invest
- Depreciation will reduce an economy's capacity
	- Machines will worsen and break over time
	- New workers need to be educated
- Investments in human and real capital need to <u>compensate for depreciation</u>
	- If investment does not happens, the PPF will slowly shift inward
- Human capital refers to work force
- Real capital refers to machines/technology

#### Erosion of Infrastructure and Human Capital
- Military conflict or national disasters can destroy factories, people, infrastructure, etc.

#### Asymmetrical Growth
- *Asymmetric growth* is when economic growth occurs from **increased productivity** in **one sector** of the economy
- If an improvement in technology applied to the motor vehicle industry, but not to the food industry, the PPF curve would shift from one axis only
	- Example PPF:

### Benefits and Costs of Economic Growth
- Economic growth incurs <span style="color:lightgreen;">benefits</span> and <span style="color:orange;">costs</span> for people's standard of living
	- Even though growth implies increasing levels of real income, therefore ability to satisfy more wants, there are <span style="color:orange;">costs</span> brought with economic growth
		- <span style="color:orange;">Costs</span> can be in the form of structural unemployment, inflation, environmental degradation and social dislocation
	- When we are talking about <span style="color:lightgreen;">benefits</span> and <span style="color:orange;">costs</span> of economic growth, we are referring to <span style="color:lime;">actual growth</span>

#### <span style="color:lightgreen;">Benefits</span> of Economic Growth
- **Increase in real income** (material welfare/standard of living)
	- Increased economic activity leads to greater income and expenditure
	- Increases in real income lead to more goods and services and better quality goods and services
- More **economic opportunities**
	- Increased GDP leads to greater production for goods and services
	- Firms have increased demand for labour to increase production
		- The increase in demand for labour lead to more economic opportunities for households
- Increase in taxation revenue → more **merit and public goods**
	- Since income for households and firms increase due to economic growth, governments get more money from taxation
		- Economic Growth → Greater Income → More Taxation
	- Governments have greater revenue to spend leading to an **increase of merit and public goods** available to society
		- *Merit goods* are goods/services that are under-consumed and thus are provided for free 
			- e.g. healthcare, transport, education, etc.
		- Greater merit and public goods leads to increases in SoL
- **Higher quality goods and services**
	- Since people's incomes are increasing leading to an increase in their purchasing power, they are more willing to buy more and/or better goods and services

#### <span style="color:orange;">Costs</span> of Economic Growth
- **Uneven growth** → widening **income gap**
	- Not everyone may experience an increase in standard of living
	- People don't receive the benefits of economic growth or receive only minimal benefits
	- Growth can widen the distribution of income because some groups may benefit much more than others
	- This can cause dissatisfaction and divide people from different classes
- Associated with a **structural change** in economy (+/-)
	- Economies can have either a positive or negative structural change
	- e.g. an economy may be based heavily around typewriters and economic growth in the computer sector leads to a shrink in the typewriter sector, it will have a big impact on the economy as it changes the structure of the economy leading to loss of jobs.
		- A fall in demand can lead to structural unemployment
- **Inflationary pressure** (demand pull)
	- Inflation caused by rising aggregate demand
		- Rising aggregate demand in the economy results in shortages which causes the price to increase
	- This occurs because aggregate supply does not increase as fast as aggregate demand
		- If aggregate supply increased at the same rate of aggregate demand, there would not be inflation, however this is not the case
- **Social Costs**
	- e.g. crime, suicide due to stress, etc.
	- Link between high levels of income and crime
		- Usually theft
	- Difficult to explain (you must link with an economic effect)
- Associated with economic 'bads' as well as 'goods'
	- Increase in the effect of negative externalities are there is an increase in the production/consumption in industries where these externalities are present
	- Environmental problems
		- e.g. pollution, congestion (negative externalities)
- **Falling Savings**
	- People have greater incomes leading to greater purchasing power leading to greater consumption
	- This means that spending increases and saving decreases
		- However this depends on what bracket of income someone is in
		- People with high incomes do not have as large of a decrease in savings as those with lower incomes
	- Falling savings can lead to people falling into debt
- Inflation and balance of payments difficulties
	- Too rapid a rate of growth can also lead to Inflationary pressure and a balance of payments deficit
	- This is because imports rise to satisfy an increasingly active household sector
