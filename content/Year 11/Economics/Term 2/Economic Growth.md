### What is Economic Growth & Why is it Important?
- [[Term 2/Economic Growth.pdf|Economic Growth PDF]]
- Economic Growth refers to an increase in the real output of goods and services in a country over time
- Economic growth can be illustrated by an outward shift of the nation's production possibility frontier (PPF) over time
- Growth is generally regarded as the most important macroeconomic objective because it determines the rate at which the 'opportunity set' if the economy expands to allow people to satisfy more wants in the future

### Determinants of Growth
- <span style="color:lime;">Actual Growth</span> vs <span style="color:gold;">Potential Growth</span>
	- <span style="color:lime;">Actual Growth</span>
		- GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
		- The actual output of the economy
		- Determinants of actual growth involve components of aggregate demand or expenditure that influence GDP
	- <span style="color:gold;">Potential Growth</span>
		- Change in quantity and/or quality of factors of production
			- The capacity of the economy
		- Determinants of potential growth involve factors the influence the quantity and/or quality of factors of production
			- These affect the supply side of the economy.

#### Investment and Economic Growth
- Allocating scarce funds to capital goods is known as **real investment**

##### Impact of Investment
- To achieve potential growth, more resources should go to **producing capital goods** over consumer goods
	- **Standards of living (SOL)** are **reduced in the short run** as resources are diverted away from private consumption
- However, increased investment in capital goods → greater output of **consumer goods** in the **long run**
	- SOL will increase in the future more than they would have if the economy had not made a short-term sacrifice
	- Economies face a **choice** between **short-term vs long-term** benefit

##### Investment in New Technology
- Potential growth increases because new technology is inevitably more efficient than old technology
	- Production can increase because the new technology is more efficient
		- Output does not necessarily increase
- Actual growth increases due to <span style="color:aqua;">investment</span>
	- There is a transaction to buy the new technology which becomes a part of the GDP

##### Failure to Invest
- Depreciation will reduce an economy's capacity
	- Machines will worsen and break over time
	- New workers need to be educated
- Investments in human and real capital need to <u>compensate for depreciation</u>
	- If investment does not happens, the PPF will slowly shift inward
- Human capital refers to work force
- Real capital refers to machines/technology

#### Erosion of Infrastructure and Human Capital
- Military conflict or national disasters can destroy factories, people, infrastructure, etc.

#### Asymmetrical Growth
- *Asymmetric growth* is when economic growth occurs from **increased productivity** in **one sector** of the economy
- If an improvement in technology applied to the motor vehicle industry, but not to the food industry, the PPF curve would shift from one axis only
	- Example PPF:

### Benefits and Costs of Economic Growth
- Economic growth incurs <span style="color:lightgreen;">benefits</span> and <span style="color:orange;">costs</span> for people's standard of living
	- Even though growth implies increasing levels of real income, therefore ability to satisfy more wants, there are <span style="color:orange;">costs</span> brough with economic growth
	- <span style="color:orange;">Costs</span> can be in the form of structural unemployment, inflation, environmental degradation and social dislocation
	- When we are talking about <span style="color:lightgreen;">benefits</span> and <span style="color:orange;">costs</span> of economic growth, we are referring to <span style="color:lime;">actual growth</span>
- <span style="color:lightgreen;">Benefits</span> of Economic Growth
	- Increase in real income (material welfare/standard of living)
		- Increased economic activity leads to greater income and expenditure
		- Increases in real income lead to more goods and services and better quality goods and services
	- More economic opportunities
		- Increased GDP leads to greater production for goods and services
		- Firms have increased demand for labour to increase production
			- The increase in demand for labour lead to more economic opportunities for households
	- A taxation dividend to government
		- Since income for households and firms increase due to economic growth, governments get more money from taxation
		- This leads to an increase of merit goods available to society, which are bought by the government
	- Higher quality goods and services
		- Since people's incomes are increasing leading to an increase in their purchasing power, they are more willing to buy more and/or better goods and services
- <span style="color:orange;">Costs</span> of Economic Growth
	- Not everyone may experience an increase in standard of living
		- Uneven growth
	- Associated with a structural change in economy (+/-)
		- Economies can have either a positive or negative structural change
		- e.g. an economy may be based heavily around typewriters and economic growth in the computer sector leads to a shrink in the typewriter sector, it will have a big impact on the economy as it changes the structure of the economy leading to loss of jobs.
			- A fall in demand can lead to structural unemployment
	- Inflationary pressure (demand pull)
		- Inflation caused by rising aggregate demand
			- Rising aggregate demand in the economy results in shortages which causes the price to increase
		- This occurs because aggregate supply does not increase as fast as aggregate demand
			- If aggregate supply increased at the same rate of aggregate demand, there would not be inflation, however this is not the case
	- Social Costs
		- e.g. crime, suicide due to stress, etc.
		- Link between high levels of income and crime
			- Usually theft
		- Difficult to explain (you must link with an economic effect)
	- Associated with economic 'bads' as well as 'goods'
		- Increase in the effect of negative externalities are there is an increase in the production/consumption in industries where these externalities are present
		- Environmental problems
			- e.g. pollution, congestion (negative externalities)
	- Falling Savings
		- People have greater incomes leading to greater purchasing power leading to greater consumption
		- This means that spending increases and saving decreases
			- However this depends on what bracket of income someone is in
			- People with high incomes do not have as large of a decrease in savings as those with lower incomes
		- Falling savings can lead to people falling into debt
	- Trade Difficulties
	- Inflation and balance of payments difficulties
		- Too rapid a rate of growth can also lead to Inflationary pressure and a balance of payments deficit
		- This is because imports rise to satisfy an increasingly active household sector
	- Widening Income Gap
		- Growth can widen the distribution of income because some groups may benefit much more than others
		- This can cause dissatisfaction and divide people from different classes
