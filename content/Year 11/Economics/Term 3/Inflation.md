### Introduction
- Inflation is a **persistent and appreciable** rise in the **general level** of prices
	- Inflation refers to the rate of change of the **general price level (GPL)**
- Rate of Inflation:
	- $\frac{Price\ Index\ in\ Year\ 2\ -\ Price\ Index\ in\ Year\ 1}{Price\ Index\ in\ Year\ 1} \times 100$
	- Measured as a <u>percentage</u>

### Price Indices
- CPI - **Consumer Price Index**
	- CPI is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services 
	  ![[CPIBasket|500]]
	- CPI takes price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods/services and averages them
		- The goods are weighted according to their importance
- RPI - Retail Price Index
- WPI - Wholesale Price Index
- PPI - Producers Price Index

### Headline and Core Inflation
- *Headline inflation* (headline rate) is a measure of inflation within an economy
	- Headline inflation may not be an accurate picture of an inflationary trend since sector-specific inflationary spikes are unlikely to persist
	- Headline inflation is what you see generally in the news
- *Core (or underlying) inflation* is calculated from a CPI minus the volatile food and energy components
	- It **removes the volatile sectors** which may influence headline inflation but should not be counted in the **inflationary trend** since the price increases **may not be persistent**
	- Core inflation is used by policy makers when making policies to avoid the distortions created by volatile price changes

### Causes of Inflation
----------------
#### Demand-Pull Inflation
- *Demand-pull inflation* occurs when **aggregate demand (AD)** <u>rises</u> **at a rate** that is **not matched by** the output of goods and services (**aggregate supply - AS**)
- Aggregate Demand (AD) = C + I + G + (X $-$ M)
	- Demand from households, firms, government and foreign sector

#### Cost-Push Inflation
- *Cost-push inflation* occurs when rising cost of production are passed on to consumers who then pay higher prices for final goods and services
	- Cost reflect the prices paid for productive inputs
	- Independent of AD

### Effects of Inflation
-----------------
##### Internal Effects
- **Consumer** Effects:
	- <u>Loss of confidence in currency</u>
		- As inflation rises, purchasing power of money falls, ceteris paribus
			- People are less willing to hold money
		- People try to preserve wealth by buying assets or foreign currency
			- Buying foreign currency causes domestic currency **depreciates** worsening inflation
	- [[Inflation_2023 v1.pdf#page=29|Redistribution of income]]
		- **Debtors** vs **Creditors**
			- Real value of debt falls → encourages borrowing
			- Real value of their loans fall when loans are repaid → discourages lending
				- Banks use interest rates to minimise the effect of inflation
		- **Variable Income** Earners vs **Fixed Income** Earners
			- Variable Income → Income is linked to GPL
				- As GPL increases, income increases as well
				- **Real value** of income **remains constant**
					- Better off
			- Fixed Income → Income does not increase with GPL
				- Purchasing power decreases
				- As GPL rises, **real value** of their income **falls**
					- Worse off
		- **Real Savings** vs **Nominal Savings**
			- Inflation erodes the value of savings (in cash)
				- <u>Savers in cash are worse off</u>
				- Purchasing power of savings fall over time
			- Those who save in terms of real assets gain, as the value of these assets tend to rise with GPL
				- <u>Savers in assets are better off</u>
- **Producer** Effects:
	- Effects on production
		- Two degrees of inflation with different effects:
			- **Mild inflation**:
				- Input **costs rise slower than** product **price**
					- Pros outweigh cons
				- Pros:
					- Stimulates production due to high expected returns 
						- Rise in investment 
						- Rise in employment and productive capacity 
				- Cons: (counterpoint - less important)
					- Rise in product prices → rise in profits
						- No incentive to conduct research and development
						- Rise in complacency and fall in efficiency 
			- **Hyperinflation**:
				- Input **costs rise faster than** product **price**
					- Cons outweigh pros
				- Cons: 
					- Business operate at a loss
						- Can lead to shut down or fall in production
				- Pros: (counterpoint - less important)
					- Surviving firms are forced to be more efficient in order to remain in business
	- Effects on **investment**
		- <u>High inflation</u> rates associated with uncertainty about the future
			- Fall in investment
				- Fall in actual and potential economic growth
			- Making planning difficult
			- Adverse effects on planned capital investments
- **Government** Effects:
	- Effects on government finance
		- Direct taxes come from incomes and profits
			- Mild inflation → greater incomes → greater tax revenue
		- In the **longer run**, **benefits cannot offset costs** of inflation on society and the economy
