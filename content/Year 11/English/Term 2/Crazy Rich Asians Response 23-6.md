> [!question] How has a central idea been constructed in the text to evoke a response from the audience?

The central idea of belonging is constructed to evoke empathy from the audience in <u>Crazy Rich Asians</u> (2019), a romantic-comedy film directed by Jon M. Chu that follows a Chinese-American professor who travels to meet her boyfriend's family and they turn out to be one of the wealthiest families in Singapore. Jon uses symbolism, audio and visual features to highlight the struggle to belong faced by the main-protagonist, Rachel Chu, due to differences in culture and class. The film endorses themes of family, cultural identity and belonging seen through Rachel's struggle to belong in Nick's family due to her American background and lack of a father. A heavy importance of putting family before one's self is conveyed throughout the film and further bars Rachel from finding a place to belong.

Near the end of the film where Eleanor is talking to Rachel on the stairs in Tyersall Park, she opens up about how Ah Ma did not believe Eleanor was good enough for her son before telling Rachel "You will never be enough." This dialogue conveys how Eleanor thinks Rachel is not good enough to belong in the family because she believes Rachel values her own dream over her family due to her American upbringing. This causes the audience to feel resentment towards Eleanor and empathise with Rachel, due to Eleanor unfairly judging Rachel by making an assumption about her, due to their differing cultures.
