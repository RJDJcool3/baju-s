### Introduction to Properties of Matter
- Properties of matter is the key to separate substances
	- Substances with different properties can be separated by **physical means**
		- Utilising different materials boiling/melting points, solubility, state, size and more can be used to separate mixtures through things like filtration

> [!example]- Definitions:
> 
> - **Solution** → homogenous mixture
> - **Solvent** → what dissolves the solute
> - **Solute** → the substance being dissolved in the solvent
> - **Residue** → a substance that is not dissolved
>$\space$
> - **Soluble** → substance that can be dissolved
> - **Precipitate** → a solid that forms when two solutions are mixed together
>$\space$
> - **Spectator ion** → ion in a chemical reaction that does not undergo a chemical change
>$\space$
> - **Saturated** → concentration of solute is at a maximum
> 	- No more solute can dissolve
> - **Unsaturated** → concentration is below maximum
> 	- More solute can dissolve
> - **Supersaturated** → the solute exceeds the maximum that can dissolve
>	- A solution can only be supersaturated for a moment before crystals start to form​

### Classification of Matter
- Classification of Matter Flowchart: 
  ![[ClassificationOfMatter|600]]
> [!tip]- Classification of Matter
> 
> - Element: (e.g. $Ne$, $Cl_2$)
> 	- The simplest type of substance that cannot be broken down into anything simpler made up of atoms with the same number of protons
> - Molecule: (e.g. ozone, $HCl\ _{(g)}$, $Cl_2$)
> 	- A group of atoms bonded together covalently
> - Compound: (e.g. $NaCl\ _{(s)}$, $HCl\ _{(g)}$)
> 	- Atoms of different elements bonded together chemically 
> 	  $\newline$
> - Mixtures
> 	- Contains two or more different substances in proportions that can vary
> 		- They can be separated by using the individual constituents properties
> 	- Homogenous: (e.g. $NaOH\ _{(aq)}$, $HCl\ _{(aq)}$, air)
> 		- Have uniform composition throughout
> 		- Includes all pure substances
> 	- Heterogenous: (e.g. milk, concrete)
> 		- Non-uniform, they constituents are physically separated
> 		$\newline$
> - Pure Substances: (e.g. ozone $(O_3)$, $NaCl\ _{(s)}$, $HCl\ _{(g)}$, $Ne$, $Cl_2$)
> 	- A pure substance has particular physical properties which do not change  and cannot be separated by physical means
> 	- Have constant chemical properties
> 	- Elements, compounds and molecules are pure substances

### Methods of Separation (TBF)
- Sieving
	- A porous material is used to separate particles of different sizes
- Filtration
	- Separates an insoluble solid from a mixture
	- The solvent can pass through the filter paper but the solid cannot
	- Scientific Diagram:
	  ![[Filtration]]
- Decanting
	- Separates particulates from a liquid by allowing the solids to settle as the bottom of the mixture and pouring off the particle-free part of the liquid
	- The liquid left in the solids must be removed later
	- This only works when the components are immiscible
- Separation Funnel (See OneNote for diagram until its updated)
	- Used to separate heterogenous mixture
	- Components will settle into different layers
- Distillation
	- Normal Distillation
		- Scientific Diagram (TBF)
		  ![[Distillation]]
	- Fractional Distillation
		- Scientific Diagram (TBF)
- Magnetic Susceptibility
- Electrostatic Attraction
- Vaporisation
- Evaporation
	- Separates a solute from a solution
	- Mixture is heated in evaporating basin
		- Solvent is evaporated leaving solid solute
	- High yield of solute
	- Solvent is lost to evaporation
		- Evaporation is used when you don't need solvent
	- Scientific Diagram:
	   ![[Evaporation]] 
- Crystallisation
	- Separates a solute from a solution
	- Cool, supersaturated solution is heated in evaporating basin
	- Pure crystals form in solvent
	- There is a large loss of solute
		- Why do we use crystallisation over evaporation sometimes?
			- Some compounds are not thermally stable and will react if you use evaporation
			- Crystallisation gives pure solid crystals without impurities like dust

- Chromatography
	- Many varying types
