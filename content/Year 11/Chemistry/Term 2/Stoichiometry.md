### Moles and Molar Mass
- <span style="color:lightgreen;">Relative atomic mass</span> $(A_r)$ is a given unit calculated from the average atomic mass of all an element's isotopes in the proportion they appear in nature
	- e.g. chlorine is made up of two isotopes 
		- $75\%$ chlorine-35 and $25\%$ chlorine-37
		- The relative atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5
			- $A_r(Cl) = 0.75 \times 35 + 0.25 \times 37 = 35.5$
	- The atomic mass constant is equal to $\frac{1}{12}$ the mass of carbon-12
	- <span style="color:#00FFFF;">Molar mass</span> is equal to an elements **relative atomic mass**
		- Thus molar mass is always given and can be used with another value to find a substances mass or moles
- <span style="color:gold;">Moles</span> are used to represent a quantity of atoms
	- One <span style="color:gold;">mole</span> of a substance is its <span style="color:#00FFFF;">molar mass</span> in grams
		- e.g. 12.01 grams of carbon is equal to 1 mole of carbon
	- One <span style="color:gold;">mole</span> is equal to $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms
		- e.g. one mole of carbon is $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms of carbon
		- $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ is Avogadro's number, it is a special pre-defined quantity
	- <span style="color:gold;">Moles</span> are used as a universal unit for quantifying atoms allowing us to find values, such as mass, volume and concentration, and convert between them
- Converting between moles, mass and molar mass

### Conversion Between Units
- <span style="color:lightgreen;">Stoichiometry</span> is the relationship between the **relative quantities** of substances taking part in a reaction or forming a compound
- In stoichiometry, we need to be able to convert between many different units
	- Lets say you want to find the mass of $NaCl$ in a solution, if you are given the concentration of $NaCl$ and the volume of solution, how do you find the mass of $NaCl$?
- There are three main groups of units used for different states of matter:
	- [[Stoichiometry#Moles and Molar Mass|Solid]] → converting between moles, mass and molar mass
	- [[Solubility#Concentration|Solution]] → converting between volume, moles and concentration
	- [[Stoichiometry#Gas Stoichiometry|Gas]] → converting between moles, volume and molar volume
- Moles can be calculated no matter what state a substance is in allowing us to calculate any unit for any substance
	- We can find the mass $NaCl$ in a solution using its concentration by converting concentration to moles and dividing moles by $NaCl$'s molar mass!

### Gas Stoichiometry
- STP → **Standard Temperature and Pressure**
	- STP is $0\degree C$ and $100\ kPa$
- Number of moles of gas at STP:
	- $n = \frac{V}{22.71}$
	- 1 mole of any gas occupies $22.71$ L at standard temperature and pressure
