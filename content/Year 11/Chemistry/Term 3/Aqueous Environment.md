### Introduction
- Water is a very effective solvent as seen from the [[Solubility#Ion-Dipole Attraction|ion-dipole attraction]] between many compounds and water
	- This can be a problem as water can be easily contaminated
		- Water quality is essential due to its many uses as drinking water, agriculture and more
- For this topic it is good to have an understanding of [[Solubility#Concentration|concentration]]

>[!hint] Potable Water
>
>Potable water is water that is safe to consume. Potable water needs to be colourless, odourless and contain no pathogens or toxic substances. It is also important to minimise the total dissolved solids (**TDS**), which includes non-toxic ions and organic matter, in drinking water for good palatability.

### Water Treatment
- Water treatment involves transforming sourced water into potable water
	- It involves the removal of contaminants from the water
- Depending on the source water was acquired from, it must be treated differently to purify it
	- Here we'll look at how different sources of water are treated

##### Seawater Treatment
- [[Properties of Matter#Distillation|Distillation]] and reverse-osmosis are two approaches typically used to treat seawater
	- In distillation, pure water is evaporated from seawater
- *Reverse-osmosis* is the process of movement of **solvent through** a semipermeable **membrane** from the solution to the pure solvent
  ![[ReverseOsmosis|450]]
	- Pure water is pushed by **high pressure** through the barrier leaving the solute on the other side
	- The substance that goes through the barrier is called the **permeate**
		- The fresh water is the permeate

##### Groundwater Treatment
- Aeration
	- Groundwater often contains unwanted dissolved gases
		- Aeration **removes** these **gases** 
	- Oxygen from the air is also incorporated into the water which helps remove dissolved organic compounds
- Clarification
	- Clarification **removes** suspended fine **particles**
	- Alum $(Al_2(SO_4)_2)$ and lime $(CaO)$ are added to the groundwater
		- Alum causes the **particles to clump together** and settle out
			- *Alum* is a **coagulant or flocculating agent**
- Sand Filtration
	- Water is passed through filter beds
		- Filter beds are made of granulated anthracite and coarse sand
		- Anthracite is very effective at adsorbing organic materials
- Disinfection
	- Pathogens may still be present in the groundwater and need to be removed
	- Chlorination or chloramination is used to disinfect the water
- Fluoridation
	- Fluoride ions in water boost tooth health, therefore a certain level of fluoride ions are maintained in the water
	- Fluoridation is the process of adjusting the level fluoride ions to the optimal (0.6-1.0 mg L$^{-1}$)
- pH
	- Water must be in a certain range for pH level (6.5 - 8.5)
	- The pH of the water is corrected by lowering or raising the pH
		- Lime (CaO) increases pH
		- Carbon dioxide lowers pH

### Water Monitoring
- Water monitoring tests several properties:
	- e.g. pH, total dissolved solids, turbidity, bacterial and viral pathogens, heavy metals, etc.
- There are guidelines for the level/concentration that things are allowed to be at for the water to be considered safe
	- The guidelines in Australia are set by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)
- Groundwater typically contains heavy metals
	- e.g. iron, aluminium and **arsenic**
