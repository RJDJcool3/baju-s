### Introduction
- Hydrocarbons are molecules that contain hydrogen and carbon only
- Hydrocarbons are broken down into different categories based around their structure
	- e.g. alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkanes
- Saturated means the bonds between carbon atoms are **only** single bonds
	- Saturated hydrocarbons are a form of alkanes/cycloalkanes

### Structure and Naming Hydrocarbons
- Structural formula (all bonds, all atoms)
	- example:
	  ![[StructuralFormula]]
- [[Hydrocarbons#General Formulas|General formula]]
	- e.g. $C_nH_{2n + 2}$ for alkanes
- Molecular formula and empirical formula
	- e.g. $C_6H_{14}$
- Condensed formula (sequence of atoms)
	- e.g. $CH_3CH(CH_3)CH_2CH_2CH_2CH_3$
	- For cyclo- hydrocarbons, you **cannot** write condensed formula in a line and must show the bonds between carbons
- Skeletal formula
	- This is only used for very big compounds
	- Example of skeletal formula:
	  ![[SkeletalFormula]]

#### General Formulas
- Alkanes → $C_nH_{2n+2}$
- Cycloalkanes → $C_nH_{2n}$
- Alkenes → $C_nH_{2n}$

### Isomers

> [!hint] **Isomers**
> 
> <u>Structural isomers</u> are <u>variations</u> of organic compounds with the **same molecular formula** with **different structures**.

#### Geometrical Isomerism
- *Geometrical isomerism* is a form of *stereoisomerism* when two or more compounds differ from each other in the <u>arrangement of </u><u>groups</u> with respect to a **double bond**, ring, or other rigid structure
	- This occurs when there is a double bond as the carbon cannot rotate around that double bond
	  ![[GeometricalIsomerism|450]]
- If geometrical isomerism can be present, we must use the prefix cis- or trans- to note the arrangement of the compound
	- **cis-** → carbon is on the same line
	- **trans-** → carbon is across
- **Criteria for geometrical isomerism**:
	- Double bond present
	- Two different groups attached to $C^2$
		- $C^n$ is the $n^{th}$ carbon in the longest chain
	- Two different groups attached to $C^3$

### Chemical Properties of Hydrocarbons
---------------
#### Chemical Properties of **Alkanes**
- Alkanes are typically unreactive except for certain types of reactions
- Alkanes react with <u>oxygen</u> in **combustion reactions**
	- **Two types** of combustion:
		- **Complete combustion** (plenty of $O_2$)
			- Carbon dioxide as a product
			- Product: $CO_2 + H_2O$
		- **Incomplete combustion** (limited supply of $O_2$)
			- Carbon OR carbon monoxide as a product
			- Products:
				- $CO + H_2O$
					- Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless toxic gas
				- $C + H_2O$
					- Carbon is in the form of soot
	- Energy is released in a combustion reaction
		- Bonds are formed releasing energy
			- The more bonds that form, the greater the energy released
			- Therefore, complete combustion creates the most energy
- <u>Substitution</u> **Reactions**
	- **Halogenation** (reaction with halogen $Cl_2,\ Br_2,\ I_2$)
		- A <u>hydrogen atom</u> is **substituted by a halogen**
			- Examples:
				- $CH_{4\ (g)} + Cl_{2\ (g)} → CH_3Cl_{\ (g)} + HCl_{\ (g)}$
				- $CH_3Cl_{\ (g)} + Cl_{2\ (g)} → CH_2Cl_{2\ (g)} + HCl_{\ (g)}$
				- $CH_2Cl_{2\ (g)} + Cl_{2\ (g)} → CHCl_{3\ (g)} + HCl_{\ (g)}$
				- $CHCl_{3\ (g)} + Cl_{2\ (g)} → CCl_{4\ (g)} + HCl_{\ (g)}$
		- Halogenation means a reaction with a halogen, it is a general term that does not necessarily refer to hydrocarbon reactions
			- <u>Substitution reaction is the proper name</u> for when referring to a hydrocarbon halogenation reaction
		- The reaction is uncontrollable because molecules are colliding erratically
			- This method is never used to manufacture these products even though they are very useful solvents

#### Chemical Properties of **Alkenes**
- <u>Addition</u> **Reactions**
	- Two reactants → one product
	- **Hydrogenation** (Saturation, $+\ H_2$)
		- Addition of hydrogen
		- Unsaturated hydrocarbon → saturated hydrocarbon
			- ALKENE $+$ <u>HYDROGEN</u> $→$ ALKANE
		- <u>Conditions for Reaction</u>:
			- Nickel catalysts
			- High temperature/pressure
	- **Halogenation** ($+\ Cl_2$ or $Br_{2\ {(aq)}}$ or $I_2$)
		- Addition of a halogen
			- Added to carbon with double bond; double bond removed
			- ALKENE $+$ <u>HALOGEN</u> $→$ HALOALKANE
		- Reaction is a test for <u>alkene</u> double bond
			- Happens readily
				- Happens without light
		- $Br_{2\ (aq)}$ → *bromine water*
			- Bromine water is an orange solution
			- Observations for bromine water halogenation:
				- Colourless gas bubbled through orange solution → orange solution becomes colourless
			- This reaction is a good test for an alkene, the solution should decolourise
	- **Hydrogen Halide** <u>Reaction</u> ($HCl_{\ (g)}$ or $HBr$ or $HI$)
		- Combination of hydrogenation and halogenation
			- ALKENE $+$ <u>HYDROGEN HALIDE</u> → HALOALKANE
			- Product gains hydrogen and halogen
	- **Hydration** ($+\ H_2O$)
		- Reaction of alkene and water
			- ALKENE $+$ <u>WATER</u> $→$ ALCOHOL
			- Product gains hydrogen and hydroxide functional group
		- <u>Conditions for Reaction</u>:
			- Phosphoric acid catalyst
			- High temperature and pressure
