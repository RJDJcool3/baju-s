My name is Ajay Bisnath, I think writing stuff on the internet about yourself is unnecessary but my best friend did it and now I feel obliged.

I'm guessing you are checking this page because you're exploring my website and know me already or maybe you actually don't know who I am. So I probably should provide some information for those in group 2.

I'm a Year 11 student who makes notes, teaches karate and doesn't have perfect pitch. I'm a studious and competitive person who doesn't understand sarcasm and has to put up with the biggest rascal I know for a best friend. Also I am clearly better at Obsidian than Jonathan.
