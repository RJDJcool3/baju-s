Lately I've been concerned about a copycat on the internet. He goes by many names, 'Binyan', 'Bingbong', but nothing can truly encapsulate his energy. Vast amounts of my work have been stolen and repurposed by this scavenger, I am greatly concerned but also flattered. I am wondering what to do. I have found a fake about me page under my name. I warn you reader to not trust this man, he is far more dangerous than he first appears. I may have to take greater measures in the future to prevent anything catastrophic.
