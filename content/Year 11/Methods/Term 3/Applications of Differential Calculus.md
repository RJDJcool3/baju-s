### Tangents and Normals
- The derivative of a function measures the **gradient of the tangent** at any point of the original function
	- We can use [[Introduction to Differential Calculus|differentiation]] to **find the equation of the tangent line** at any point of a function
		- The equation of a straight line is $y = mx + c$
			- For the tangent, $m$ equals the derivative
- The **tangent equation** at point $(x_1,\ y_1)$: → $y - y_1 = f'(x_1)(x - x_1)$ 
	- e.g. Let $x_1 = 1$, $f(x) = x^2 + 3x$
		- $\therefore \ y_1 = 4$, $f'(x) = 2x + 3$
		- The tangent at $x = 1$ → $y - 4 = (2(1) + 3)(x - 1)$ → $y = 5x - 1$

- The *normal* is the line which passes through a point and is **perpendicular to the tangent** at that point
	- Thus the **gradient** of the normal is the **negative reciprocal** of the gradient of the tangent
		- If the tangent has gradient $m$ → the normal has gradient $-\frac{1}{m}$
	- We can calculate the equation of the normal by using the same equation for the tangent while changing the gradient

#### Stationary Points
- Points where the derivative = 0 are called stationary points
	- A point $(a, f(a))$ is considered to be a stationary point if $f'(a) = 0$
		- The tangent to these points are parallel to the $x$-axis
	- Points $A$, $B$ and $C$ are stationary points below:
	  ![[StationaryPoints]]
	- Turning points are stationary points
		- Sine and cosine functions and straight lines ($y = a$) have infinite stationary points

##### Types of Stationary Points
- [[Cambridge Methods (Outdated).pdf#page=668|Cambridge - 18D]]
- There are 3 types of stationary points:
  ![[TypesOfStationaryPoints]]
	- Point $A$ is known as a **local maximum** point
		- $f'(x) > 0$ to the left of $A$
		- $f'(x) < 0$ to the right of $A$
	- Point $B$ is known as a **local minimum** point
		- $f'(x) < 0$ to the left of $A$
		- $f'(x) > 0$ to the right of $A$
	- Point $C$ is known as a **stationary point of inflection**
		- <u>Either:</u>
			- $f'(x) < 0$ to the left and right of $C$
			- $f'(x) > 0$ to the left and right of $C$
	- Points $A$ and $B$ are known as *turning points*
- For a function defined on an interval:
	- The **actual maximum value** of the function is called the **absolute maximum**
	- The **actual minimum value** of the function is called the **absolute minimum**
