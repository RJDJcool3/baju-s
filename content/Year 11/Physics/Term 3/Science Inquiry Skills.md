### Scientific Skills
- **Accuracy**
	- How close your experimentally derived number is to the “true” or “real” quantity being measured
- **Validity**
	- No other variables, known or unknown, are impacting the independent or dependent variables
- **Reliability**
	- Getting similar results after repeating trials
- **Precision**
	- How the repeat values or a given trial are to each other <u>or</u> the fineness of the scale on the instrument being used to take measurements

### Types of Error
----------------
##### Measurement Uncertainty
- Uncertainty which is a property of the measuring instrument
	- Unavoidable
- Give the error value with the recorded value
	- e.g. $3.00 \pm 0.005 cm$

- **Absolute Error** ($A\ u$) =  the smallest unit of scale on the instrument
	- $A\ u$ = half the smallest unit of scale on the instrument
	- Absolute error will be the same for every measurement taken by a given instrument
- **Percentage error** ($\%\ u$)
	- $\%\ u = \frac{A\ u}{measurement} \times 100\%$

- **Rules** for measurement uncertainty:
	1. If adding or subtracting measurements **add the absolute errors**
	2. If multiplying or dividing measurements **add the percentage errors**

-----------------
##### Systematic Error
- Impacts each trial in the same direction away from the true value
	- Bias in direction
---------------------
##### Random Error
- Impacts each trial but with no bias in direction, and if truly random, should cancel out with respect to accuracy
