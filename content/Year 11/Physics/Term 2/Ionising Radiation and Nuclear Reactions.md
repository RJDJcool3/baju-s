### Isotopes and Radioisotopes
- Isotopes are variations of an element with different numbers of neutrons
	- They have the same number of protons and the same chemical properties
	- However, due to their mass numbers being different, they have different physical properties
- Some isotopes nuclei are unstable leading to them undergoing some form of decay in order to become more stable
	- These unstable atoms are known as <span style="color:yellow;">radioisotopes</span> and are radioactive
		- e.g. carbon-14 is a naturally occurring isotope of carbon that is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay to form nitrogen-14

### Radioactive Decay
- When a <span style="color:yellow;">radioisotope</span> undergoes radioactive decay, it will emit a high-energy particle or wave (radiation), there are several types of particles/waves emitted during radioactive decay:
	- <span style="color:OrangeRed;">Alpha</span> Particles - $\alpha$
		- ${4\atop2}\alpha$ → an alpha particle is a helium nucleus (2 protons, 2 neutrons)
		- Parent atom loses two protons and two neutrons during alpha decay
			- Atomic number decreases by 2, mass number decreases by 4
		- Alpha particles have very **low** penetrating power
			- Can be stopped by paper (therefore it can't penetrate the body)
		- Highly ionising
			- Can be very dangerous if alpha particles are emitted within the body
				- Interesting case where a spy was assassinated by poisoning them with a sample of a radioisotope in their drink that underwent alpha decay in his stomach in early 2000s
		- Fast as 10% of the speed of light
	- <span style="color:aqua;">Beta</span> Particles - $\beta$
		- ${0\atop-1}\beta$ → a beta particle is an electron 
		- Parent atom turns a neutron into a proton and electron, releasing the electron
			- Atomic number increases by 1, mass number does not change
		- Beta particles have **medium** penetrating power
			- Can be stopped by metal 
		- Weakly ionising
		- Fast as 90% of the speed of light
	- <span style="color:aqua;">Beta+</span> Particles - $\beta^+$ 
		- ${0\atop+1}\beta$ → a positively charged beta particle is a <span style="color:gold;">positron</span>
			- Has the same properties as electrons, but is positively charged
			- Positrons are a form of **antimatter**
		- Parent atom turns a proton turns into a neutron, positron and a neutrino $(v)$ and the positron and neutrino are emitted
			- Atomic number decreases by 1, mass number does not change
	- <span style="color:limegreen;">Gamma</span> Waves - $\gamma$
		- ${0\atop0}\gamma$ → gamma radiation is an electromagnetic wave with a very high frequency and small wavelength
		- Parent atom transitions from an excited state to a base state
			- Atom is unchanged
		- Gamma waves have **very high** penetrating power
			- Can be stopped by thick lead, penetrates everything else
		- Very weakly ionising
		- Fast as light
- Nuclear equations must always show mass number, atomic number and chemical symbol for all components

### Fission and Fusion
- Textbook: [[Pearson - Physics - Year 11.pdf#page=96|Pearson]]
- <span style="color:orange;">Fission</span> is the process in which an atom is split by a neutron into smaller atoms
	- Model Equation: ${x \atop y}A_p + {0\atop1}n → {x_1 \atop y_1}A_1 + {x_2 \atop y_2}A_2 + 2{0\atop1}n + {0\atop0}\gamma$
		- $x_1 + x_2 = x,\ \ y_1 + y_2 = y$
	- When a large nuclei is bombarded by a neutron, it usually causes it to become unstable which leads to it splitting into smaller fragments
	- A fission reaction can emit 2 or 3 neutrons
	- There can be more than two products however the combined mass and atomic number will still equal the parent atom's mass and atomic number
	- Certain terms are used to describe nuclei in reference to fission:
		- **Fissionable** refers to nuclide which **can** undergo fission
		- **Fissile** refers to nuclides which will **readily** undergo fission
			- e.g. $U^{235},\ U^{238},\ Pu^{239},\ Th^{232}$
			- There are only a small number of fissile elements
	- Chain Reaction: The products of 1 fission reaction acts as the successful reactant in further fission reactions
	  ![[ChainReaction]]
		- 3 ways to avoid a bomb:
		  1. Concentration of fissile material
		      - Percentage of isotope $U^{235}$ in uranium in uranium:
			    - naturally ~ 0.7%
			    - power station ~ 4%
			    - bomb ~ 90%
		  2. Amount of fuel
		  3. Shape of fuel 
	
- <span style="color:pink;">Fusion</span> is the process in which two or more atoms are combined into a larger atom
	- Model Equation: ${x_1 \atop y_1}A_1 + {x_2 \atop y_2}A_2 → {x \atop y}A_r$
		- $x_1 + x_2 = x,\ \ y_1 + y_2 = y$
	- The resultant atom will have the combine mass and atomic number of all the components 

### Nuclear Power Stations (Fission)
- ##### Three Challenges for Thermal Nuclear Reactors:
	1. Neutrons emitted by uranium-235 (fuel) are very fast but uranium-235 is most fissile when irradiated by **slow-moving neutrons**
		- The emitted neutrons need to be slowed down to continue an efficient chain reaction
	2. Uranium-235 fission emits an average of 2.47 neutrons which need to be controlled as **it could cause an explosion**
	3. The heat generated in the reactor from the fission needs to be collected for electricity generation


>[!tip]+ Uranium-235
>
>Uranium-235 is a readily fissile isotope of uranium. The more common isotope of uranium, $U^{238}$, is not fissile and makes up over 99% of naturally found uranium. This means naturally found uranium does not have enough uranium-235 to undergo chain-reactions.
>
>Due to how low of a proportion uranium-235 makes up of natural uranium, uranium must be enriched with uranium-235 to be used as a fuel source. The different isotopes can be separated due to their difference in mass, however, the process of enriching uranium is very difficult and expensive

##### Components of a nuclear power station
- Fuel Rods
	- Fuel rods are long, thin rods the contain pellets of enriched uranium
	- The fuel rods need to be able to sustain their own chain reaction
	- Fuel rods use uranium with 4% uranium-235
		- The enriched uranium (in pellet form) is packed into a thin aluminium tube 3-5 metres long
		  
		![[FuelRods.png|300]]
	- A large nuclear reactor has over 1000 fuel rods in its core
		- Fuel rods need to be replaced around every 4 years

>[!abstract] Uranium-238 → Plutonium-239
>While uranium-238 is not readily fissile, it is classified as 'fertile' because it can form plutonium-239 after capturing a fast neutron, a product of uranium-235 fission. Plutonium-239 is readily fissile and releases similar energy to uranium-235 allowing it to sustain the chain reaction.
 
- Moderator
	- A material that slows down the neutrons (easier to be captured by nuclides)
		- e.g. water, heavy water, graphite, carbon dioxide
			- Heavy water is the most effective moderator but is also the most expensive
			- Water is the cheapest but absorbs a lot of neutrons reducing the extent of the chain reaction
- Control Rods
	- A nuclear reactor can also produce great amounts of energy but the energy release must be controlled
		- This is achieved by controlling the number of neutrons that are involved in the fission chain reaction
	- Control rods are material that absorbs excess neutrons
		- e.g. cadmium, boron steel
			- When a neutron strikes a control rod, it is absorbed into the nucleus of the material
- Coolant
	- The core of a nuclear reactor can reach very high temperature (500-1500$\degree$C)
	- The coolant is a liquid that run through pipes to absorb heat energy that has been produced from the core
		- e.g. water, heavy liquid, carbon dioxide, liquid sodium
- Heat Exchanger
	- A heat exchanger transfers the heat created in the reactor into pipes containing water
		- This water is converted into high-pressure steam that is used to rotate the turbines that drive the generator
- Radiation Shield
	- The radiation shield protects workers and the surrounding environment from exposure to radiation leaks from the core of the reactor
		- e.g. lead, concrete, graphite

##### Nuclear Waste Management
- Low Level Waste
	- e.g. protective clothing, wrappings, containers of isotopes
	- Processed by incineration, burying and *flushing*
- Medium Level Waste
	- e.g. reactor component, chemical sludge
	- Processed by solidifying in concrete or burying
- High Level Waste
	- e.g. spent rods, liquid waste
	- Processed by coolant ponds or kept in secure storage
		- Spent fuel rods can be repurposed into new fuel, however the process is very expensive
	- High-level waste must be stored permanently due to how long the half-lives are for the radioactive materials

### Mass Defect and Nuclear Binding Energy
- The mass of any given nuclide is <u>less</u> than the sum of the individual masses of the protons and neutrons of which it is composed
	- i.e. there is a <span style="color:gold;"><u>mass defect</u></span>
- The <span style="color:gold;">mass defect</span> is the difference between the expected total mass of a nucleus (mass of nucleons) and the actual total mass recorded (mass of nucleus)
	- *<i><span style="color:gold;">Mass Defect</span></i> = Mass of Nucleons - Mass of Nucleus*
- The reason that the total mass is less than the expected mass is due to some mass becoming converted to <span style="color:aqua;">nuclear binding energy</span> which is lost in order for the nucleus to hold together
	- Energy and mass are interchangeable through the equation $E = mc^2$ 
	- The <span style="color:aqua;">nuclear binding energy</span> is not responsible for holding the nucleus together
- The <span style="color:aqua;">nuclear binding energy</span> is the energy equivalent of the mass lost during nucleosynthesis
	- The <span style="color:aqua;">nuclear binding energy</span> is the energy that would have to be <u>added</u> to the nucleus to restore the mass defect
- The more <span style="color:aqua;">nuclear binding energy</span> per nucleon, the more stable the nuclei
	- Iron-56 has the most stable nuclei

##### Atomic Mass: (Atomic Mass Units - amu/u)
- Proton: $1.007276$
- Neutron: $1.008665$
- $1\ u$ = one unified **atomic mass unit**

##### Conversion Formulas: (From [[Physics_Formulae_and_Data_sheet_YEAR_11_2020.pdf|Formula Sheet]])
- $1\ u = 1.66 \ ×\ 10^{-27}$kg (mass-to-mass)
- $1\ u =931\ MeV$ (mass-to energy)
- $1\ eV = 1.60\ ×\ 10^{-19}J$ (energy-to-energy)
	- $1\ eV\ ×\ 10^{-6} = 1\ MeV$
	- $1\ MeV = 1,000,000\ eV$

### Half-Life
- Radioisotopes decay sporadically and thus can be difficult to measure the decay rate by normal means
- Instead, radioactive decay is measured in half-lives
	- A <span style="color:lightgreen;">half-life</span> is the amount of time it takes for half of the radionuclides in a sample of a given radioisotope to decay
- Half-life is graphed using an exponential graph measuring the count rate (radiation) over time
  ![[HalfLifeGraph]]
- Possible ways to measure half-life (with problems):
	1. Number of nuclides
	   - However the decayed nuclides are now nuclides of a different isotope
	2. Mass
	   - However actual mass of entire sample will not change significantly since little actual mass is lost, most is converted into mass of other isotopes
	3. Activity measured - disintegrations per second (dps) or becquerel (Bq)
	   - The Geiger counter can't discriminate between 2 or more decays occurring simultaneously
	   - The Geiger counter will count decay from radioactive daughter nuclide and it 
- Finding the number of radionuclides present:
	- N = Number of radionuclides remaining at present time
		- N = N$_0 * \frac{1}{2}^n$ \[on data sheet]
		- N$_0$ = Original # of radionuclides (at t$_0$)
		- n = Number of half-lives which have elapsed
			- n = $\frac{t}{t_\frac{1}{2}}$ \[not on data sheet]
				- Where $t$ = elapsed time and $t\frac{1}{2}$ = half life of isotope

### Strong Nuclear Force
- <span style="color:lightgreen;">Strong nuclear force</span> is the force between protons and neutrons that hold the nucleus together
- Protons are like-charged particles, meaning they repel each other through electrostatic forces
	- However, strong nuclear force is much stronger, overpowering the electrostatic forces and holding the nucleus together
- Neutrons are attracted to neutrons and protons
	- There needs to be a certain number of neutrons to hold the nucleus together
		- The number of neutrons and protons need to balance out each other, too many or few neutrons can lead to the nucleus falling apart and undergoing radioactive decay
		- For larger nuclei, there needs to be more neutrons than protons to overcome the strong electrostatic force of attraction
