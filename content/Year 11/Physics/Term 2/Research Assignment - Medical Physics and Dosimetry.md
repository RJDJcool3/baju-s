##### [[../Physics Home - Year 11|‚Üê Physics Home]]

Research and make notes on the following concepts:
- The use of radioisotopes in diagnostic imaging including gamma cameras and
PET scans
- The use of radioisotopes in therapeutic treatments
- The main ways in which radioisotopes are produced for use in medicine
- Proton therapy and Neutron therapy
- Radiation Dosimetry including Absorbed dose and Dose Equivalent.

### Use of Radioisotopes in Diagnostic Imaging
- A <span style="color:lightgreen;">gamma camera</span> (or SPECT camera) is a camera that detects flashing light (scintillons) produced by gamma rays interacting with a sodium iodide ($NaI$) crystal at the front of the camera
	- The gamma camera detects the energy from a **radiotracer** in your body and converts it into an image, it has radiation detectors called gamma camera heads 
		- A radiotracer (**radioactive tracer**) is a chemical compound in which one or more atoms have been replaced by a radioisotope
	- The gamma camera itself does not emit any radiation
- <span style="color:lightblue;">Positron emission tomography (PET) scans</span> are a **medical imaging procedure** that provides unique information about how an organ or system in the body is working
	- PET scans are mainly used to assess cancers, neurological (brain) diseases and cardiovascular (heart-related) disease

### Use of Radioisotopes in Therapeutic Treatments
- Radioisotopes can be used to kill cancer cells
- As the radioisotope begins to decay, it affects the targeted tissue or tumour because cancer cells absorb more of the radioisotope than noncancer cells do. The higher dose of radiation eventually destroys the cancer cells.
